- 👋 Hi, I’m @Tempestas08.
- 👀 I’m interested in Swift - I mostly use Apple products, and I would love to learn more about building for the devices I use. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the absolute basics haha. HTML and CSS at the moment! I'm mostly using Mimo to learn but I'm hoping to branch out...
- 💞️ At the moment, I’m not looking to collaborate on anything - I'm much too inexperienced, but I'd love any pointers on where and how to learn new things.
- 📫 You can reach me here, at the moment. I'm probably going to add some socials soon but I don't do much on social media at this time.
