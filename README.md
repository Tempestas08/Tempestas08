- 👋 Hi, I’m @Tempestas08.
- - 🌱 I’m currently learning the absolute basics haha. HTML and CSS at the moment!
- 👀 I’m interested in Swift - I mostly use Apple products, and I would love to learn more about building for the devices I use. 
- 🛜 I'm mostly using Codecademy and Mimo to learn atm.
- 💞️ Right now, I’m not looking to collaborate on anything - I'm much too inexperienced - but I'd welcome any pointers on how and where to learn new things.
- 📫 You can reach me here, at the moment. I'm probably going to add some socials soon but I don't do much on social media these days.
